# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section

## user_problem_statement: Build a bold, dark neon landing for King of Gambler ($KOG) with 3D right-side visual, gold accents, Buy on DEX + community CTAs, and a Copy Contract pill. Replace mocks with backend.

## backend:
  - task: "Public content API (/api/content) with default seeding"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: false
        agent: "main"
        comment: "Implemented GET/PUT /api/content with Mongo seed; needs testing via deep agent."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ PASSED: GET /api/content returns seeded defaults with correct schema (hero, tokenomics, howToBuy, roadmap, faqs, config). No Mongo _id leaks detected. PUT /api/content successfully updates config.contractAddress and hero.ctas.dexUrl with proper persistence verified."
  - task: "Status check baseline endpoints"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "low"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: false
        agent: "main"
        comment: "Carry-over endpoints; verify still OK."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ PASSED: GET /api/ returns correct 'Hello World' message. POST /api/status with {client_name: 'tester'} creates entry successfully. GET /api/status returns array with created entry. All responses follow correct models without Mongo _id leaks."

## frontend:
  - task: "Landing page UI + gold accents + lazy Spline + Copy Contract + backend integration via useContent"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: false
        agent: "user"
        comment: "Initial timeout reported due to load; addressed with Spline lazy-load."
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "UI renders; Copy Contract shows TBA until backend config set; CTAs show toasts when URLs missing."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PASSED: 1) Header elements all present (KING OF GAMBLER title, nav links for Tokenomics/How to Buy/Roadmap/FAQ, Copy Contract pill, Buy on DEX button). 2) Copy Contract shows appropriate toast ('Copy failed - Clipboard unavailable in this browser' due to test environment). 3) Scroll navigation works perfectly - all sections (Tokenomics, How to Buy, Roadmap, FAQ) are visible when nav links clicked. 4) FAQ accordion functions correctly - 'What chain is $KOG on?' opens and shows content '$KOG launches on Ethereum...'. 5) Spline lazy-load works without runtime errors, page remains interactive. 6) Admin page fully functional - password 'KOG2025' works, contract address and DEX URL can be updated and saved successfully. 7) Backend integration working - data loads from /api/content endpoint. Minor: Buy on DEX doesn't show toast when valid URL is set (expected behavior for external links)."
